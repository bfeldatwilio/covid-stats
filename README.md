# Getting started with the Covid Data Application

You will notice the map in the background changes to the country you selected, and the data on the map reflects that country you selected.

## Sending a Text of the countries statistics

After choosing a country, you can send yourself a text with the countries statistics by clicking the "Send to my Phone" button below the statistics. (This is not visible on a mobile device). After pressing the button, you can enter a phone number and click the send button.

## Manipulating the reference table

The darker section houses the reference table where you can view the top ten countries. Sort by confirmed cases, recovered, and deaths. Also aggregate those categories by total or daily.
